### **What is a Loader?**  

A **loader** is a system software component that loads an executable program into memory and prepares it for execution. It is a part of the **operating system (OS)** and works closely with the **linker** to ensure the program runs correctly.  

---

## **üîπ Functions of a Loader**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Loads the Program into Memory**  
   - Reads the executable file from storage (HDD/SSD).  
   - Allocates memory space in **RAM** for the program.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Relocates the Program (If Needed)**  
   - Adjusts memory addresses if the program is **not loaded at its preferred address**.  
   - Uses relocation information provided by the **linker**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Resolves External References**  
   - If the program depends on external libraries, the loader **links them dynamically**.  
   - Ensures required system libraries (DLL files in Windows, shared libraries in Linux) are available.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Initializes Execution**  
   - Sets up the **stack and heap**.  
   - Transfers control to the program's **entry point (main function)**.

## **üîπ Types of Loaders**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Absolute Loader**  
- Loads the program at a fixed memory address.  
- No relocation is required.  
- **Used in embedded systems and early computers.**  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Relocating Loader**  
- Adjusts the program‚Äôs addresses to fit in available memory.  
- **Used in modern OS where memory locations vary.**  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Loader**  
- Loads **parts of a program only when needed** (on demand).  
- Commonly used for **shared libraries (DLL, .so files)**.  
- **Example**: Loading a graphics library only when required in a game.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Bootstrap Loader (Bootloader)**  
- Loads the OS into memory when the computer starts.  
- **Example**: BIOS/UEFI loading Windows/Linux from disk.  

---

## **üîπ Steps of Loader Execution**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Loading Phase**
   - The loader reads the executable file from disk.  
   - It finds a suitable memory location in **RAM**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Relocation Phase**
   - If required, adjusts memory addresses in the program.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Linking Phase**
   - Loads external libraries (if needed).  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Phase**
   - Transfers control to the program's entry point (`main` function).  
   - The program starts running.  

---

## **üîπ Example of Loader in Action**  

### **Scenario: Running a C Program (`a.out`) in Linux**
1Ô∏è‚É£ You compile a C program:  
   ```sh
   gcc program.c -o program
   ```
2Ô∏è‚É£ You run the program:  
   ```sh
   ./program
   ```
3Ô∏è‚É£ The **loader**:  
   - Loads `program` into memory.  
   - Links required libraries (e.g., `libc.so`).  
   - Transfers control to `main()`.

## **üîπ Difference Between Loader & Linker**  

| Feature  | Loader | Linker |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Loads program into memory | Combines object files & resolves symbols |
| **Execution Time** | Happens at **runtime** | Happens at **compile-time or load-time** |
| **Relocation** | Adjusts addresses in RAM | Prepares relocation data |
| **Type** | Absolute, Relocating, Dynamic | Static, Dynamic |

---

## **üîπ Summary**  
‚úÖ **A loader is a system program that loads an executable into memory and starts execution.**  
‚úÖ **It performs relocation, linking, and memory allocation.**  
‚úÖ **Different types include absolute, relocating, dynamic, and bootstrap loaders.**  
‚úÖ **Works with the linker to ensure external libraries are available at runtime.**
