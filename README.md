### **1. State Space Search - Notes with Steps**  

State space search is a problem-solving technique in Artificial Intelligence (AI) where we explore a set of possible states to reach a goal state.

## **1. Key Components**  
1. **State**: A representation of a problem at any given time.  
2. **Initial State**: The starting state of the problem.  
3. **Goal State**: The desired final state.  
4. **Operators (Actions)**: Rules that define how one state transitions to another.  
5. **State Space**: The collection of all possible states generated by applying operators.  
6. **Search Strategy**: The approach used to explore the state space.

## **2. Steps in State Space Search**  
### **Step 1: Define the Problem**  
- Identify the **initial state**.  
- Define the **goal state**.  
- List all possible **actions (operators)**.

### **Step 2: Represent the State Space**  
- Construct a **graph/tree** where:  
  - Nodes represent **states**.  
  - Edges represent **transitions between states**.  

### **Step 3: Choose a Search Algorithm**  
Two main types:  

#### **1. Uninformed (Blind) Search – No Prior Knowledge**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Expands all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper.  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.  
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Expands the least-cost node first.

#### **2. Informed (Heuristic) Search – Uses Heuristics**  
- **Greedy Best-First Search**: Selects the node that appears closest to the goal.  
- **A* Search**: Uses both the cost to reach the node and an estimated cost to the goal.

### **Step 4: Execute the Search**  
- Start from the **initial state**.  
- Apply operators to generate **new states**.  
- Use a **queue (BFS), stack (DFS), or priority queue (A*)** to explore states.  
- Continue until the **goal state** is found or all states are exhausted.

### **Step 5: Solution Extraction**  
- If the **goal state** is reached, trace back the path to find the solution.  
- If not, conclude that **no solution exists**.

## **3. Example: Solving a Maze**  
### **Problem Representation**  
- **State**: Position in the maze.  
- **Initial State**: Starting position.  
- **Goal State**: Exit of the maze.  
- **Operators**: Move up, down, left, or right.  
- **State Space**: All possible paths in the maze.  
- **Search Algorithm**: A* Search (for shortest path).
