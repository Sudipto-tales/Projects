**Best First Search**
Best-First Search(Graph, start, goal):
    1. Create an empty priority queue (open list) and add the start node.
    2. Create an empty set (closed list) to track visited nodes.
    
    3. While the open list is not empty:
        a. Remove the node with the lowest heuristic value (best node) from the queue.
        b. If this node is the goal, return the path.
        c. Add this node to the closed list (mark as visited).
        
        d. For each neighbor of the current node:
            i. If the neighbor is not in the closed list:
                - Calculate the heuristic value h(n).
                - Add the neighbor to the open list (priority queue).
    
    4. If the loop ends without finding the goal, return "No Path Found".
